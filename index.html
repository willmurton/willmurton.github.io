                <p>Hello, reader! My name is William and this is my brand-new website. This site will be filled with information that'll let you know a little bit about me, the things I am passionate about, and a bop that keeps me going throughout the day. Now before we begin, please press play on my embedded audio <i>(Unbreakable Smile - Tori Kelly)</i> up on the right. It speaks volumes about the way I live my life. Done? Okay cool, here we go! <p>I am an extroverted eighteen year old male with an undying love for my pal's, Dungeons and Dragons, board games, animation and visual effects, my animals, my family, musical theatre and visual design. Christchurch born, there was always a reason for me to be out and about, swimming and surfing, gaming with my friends, and rehearsing with companies for upcoming shows. In the spring months I usually spend some time skiing at Porter's, a few hours west of christchurch, with my dad and sisters. Oh yes, I am one of five siblings, smack bang in the middle of two older sisters and two younger brothers. Dream life, eh? Ha. My dog, Tessa, provides copious amounts of joy. I'm  always laughing as she makes a fool of herself on the daily. I also own two cats - Kommett (we like to think he's Russian) and Ziggy (if you don't know who David Bowie is, we can't be friends. I'm sorry, It's personal).</p>
                <p>Why this backdrop and theme? I'm glad you asked, my lovely reader. I say 'reader', for I do believe it would be awkward for me, a poor student, to refer to you by your real name. I do sincerely apologise... THEME. RIGHT. Autumn. It goes without saying, really, that autumn is my favourite season. Closely followed by winter. There's just something about the orange and red leaves that fall from the trees and gather on the ground, paired with the constant and unpredictable weather patterns that speak to me on so many levels. It's probably because I'm a Leo. That's okay, though, for my life is usually built on irrational choices, trusting my instincts, and not thinking before I speak. I'll learn one day... I hope.</p><p>Well I do believe that is quite enough about my random personal life, let's crack on with the exciting elements of this page!!

            <h1>Dungeons and Dragons</h1>
                <p>This area of gaming is, to be honest, one of my favourite passtimes. I'm a huge fan of this roleplay game, and will always say yes to playing it. I began playing Dungeons and Dragons in 2016, with a small bunch of my freinds, and have followed my passion through to today. Below I will include some information about my favourite characters I've played throughout the years, accompanied by the images I have photoshopped of them. </p>
            
            <h2>Khanra Taikishi</h2>
            <div id="khanra" class="characters">
                Born and raised just outside of the central cities in the world of Vandicar, Khanra Taikishi is an accomplished Divination Wizard currently at Level Eight. Khanra's mother was also a diviner, though she was executed after correctly predicting the mayor of their town's death. She was suspected of playing part in assassinating him, as she was always looked down upon as insane for her magical abilities at predicting the future and foreseeing these events. After being banished, Khanra and his family went into hiding, surviving in the forest. Khanra's two brothers and father were taken from him while he was studying with a hedge mage he came across. He began adventuring to recover his remaining family. His journey with his party has seen him adventure out to the ocean, survive a shipwreck, defaeat Yuan-ti Purebloods, Dragons and make deals with multiple evil entities. The diviner has played a part in acquiring three of the eight most powerful artifacts in the realm, which, when joined together, form a sphere of immense power, allowing one to achieve godlike powers. Hearing word of a large-scale battle in the Central Cities between the eight schools of magic, as well as his brother's potential location at the Divination Tower, Khanra swiftly returned to the Divination District in the city.  He began working as a private messenger sworn under a vow of secrecy for the messages he is delivering. Khanra hopes to help put an end to the war amongst the districts and help his party (currently adventuring elsewhere) keep the Infinity Spindle fragments out of the hands of dangerous influencers. In the city, he also hopes to finally reunite with his lost brothers and father.

            <h2>Kortez Teyacapan</h2>
            <div id="kortez" class="characters">
                Born in Neverwinter, Kortez lived a prodigal life as a Noble child. At the young age of seven, Kor was inducted into the Order of the Dark Moon, a Monastery specialising in Shadow Art, under the religion of Shar. Teyaca House was impressed with Korfana and kept him training in the monastery under abusive leadership and guidance. Through these years, Kor built up a strong mind and impressive prowess in combat and stealth, training himself to block out his home life as well as the unjust system of training he was undertaking. Finally twenty-one, Kortez left his monsatery and family, never looking back. He joined the Harper Faction as a reconaissance agent and is currently working for them. Following the movements of an evil Red Wizard, he found company alongside an adventuring party, who he is now working with investigating the rise of dragons in the world of Faerún. Under a false name and new identity, Shadow Monk "Korfana Mégano" has been working behind the scenes with other faction agents, as well as this travelling party to put a stop to the Tyranny of Dragons around these realms. He is currently Level Three.

            <h2>West Crawford</h2>
            <div id="kortez" class="characters">
                West is a new character I've been designing. He hasn't had much backstory yet, as he's still in development, though I have designed his character to be a Grave domain Cleric of the Raven Queen. Clerics are divine agents of the deities, working with magic and weapons to bring the will of their specific deity to the material plane. Clerics are, in some ways, personifications of these divine beings in the material world. West was chosen by a mysterious deity known as the Raven Queen, his left eye blinded by a raven from the Queen herself. She is the medium between a dying soul and the plane that they end up going to. As you depart your life, your soul . travels to your destined plane, and the Raven Queen oversees this. She can sometimes choose people of interest to return to their plane under her will, or she may find someone who she thinks has more purpose on their plane, in which case she . intervenes with t heir . departing soul and can sometimes breathe life back into a lifeless body. Either way, the Raven Queen belongs to the domain of Death, and a grave domain cleric are the divine agents who work within this delicate balance. They mark life forces for termination, resurrect dead souls, and put a stop to death in its tracks. The delicate line here is that a grave domain cleric knows that no one truely escapes death, and that this meddling is only on borrowed time. Everyone dies, and a Grave  Cleric will see to it that an individual who's time is up will find their eventual rest.

            <h1>theatre credits</h1>
            <p>Musical Theatre has become a huge part of my life since broadening my horizons from choral and orchestral performances in my primary and intermediate years. I began performing with <a target=_blank href="https://www.showbiz.org.nz/" >Showbiz Christchurch</a> in their productions, building a performance CV with this semi-professional company. I have been involved with multiple productions throughout my teenage years, performing in <i>Hairspray</i> (2016), <i>Sister Act</i> (2017), <i>The Sound of Music</i> (2017), <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> (2017), <i>Wicked</i> (2018), and <i>Broadway Hitmen</i> (2018). I have performed with Burnside High School and the <i>North Canterbury Musical Society</i> as well, alongside the various choral ensembles I was included in . Below I have included a few photos of highlight productions, which I was so privileged to be a part of. Theatre is such a masive passion of mine, and I love performing alongside such talented individuals and fun companies.</p>
